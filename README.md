## What is a CTF?

A CTF (Capture The Flag) is a cybersecurity competition. Participants must retrieve text strings called "flags" by completing challenges in cryptography,
reverse engineering, forensics, web exploitation, and more. Check out [CTFtime](https://ctftime.org/) for more information and to register for a CTF yourself!
