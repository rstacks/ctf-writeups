## What is a CTF?

A CTF (Capture The Flag) is a cybersecurity competition. Participants must retrieve text strings called "flags" by completing challenges in cryptography,
reverse engineering, forensics, web exploitation, and more. Check out [CTFtime](https://ctftime.org/) for more information and to register for a CTF yourself!

## Software and Tools

Here is a short list of some of the tools I frequently use during CTFs:
- [CyberChef](https://cyberchef.org/) for cryptography challenges
- [dogbolt.org](https://dogbolt.org/) for analyzing executables for reverse engineering challenges
- [Burp Suite](https://portswigger.net/burp/communitydownload) for web exploitation challenges
- [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/) for networking challenges

I'm currently using an [Ubuntu 22.04](https://ubuntu.com/desktop) laptop, along with [Kali Linux](https://www.kali.org/) through [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/).
